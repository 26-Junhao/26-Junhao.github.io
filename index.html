            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>
                The origins of darts can be traced back to medieval times in England. <br>
                Soldiers during the Middle Ages used to throw short arrows at the bottom of a wine barrel or a wooden
                target to pass the time. <br>
                As the game evolved, the wooden target became a circular board, and the arrows were eventually replaced
                with darts.
            </p>

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <p>
                The game's popularity increased in the 19th century, particularly in the United Kingdom. <br>
                It was played as a pub game, with various rules and regional variations. The standardization of the game
                <br>
                began in the early 20th century when the National Darts Association (NDA) was formed in Britain.
            </p>

            <h3>Standardization</h3>
            <p>
                The NDA, established in 1924, played a significant role in standardizing the rules and regulations of
                darts. <br>
                They introduced the numbering system we see on dartboards today, where the numbers 1 to 20 are arranged
                in a specific pattern. <br>
                The bullseye, the central circle, was also included as a high-scoring area.
            </p>

            <h3>Television Era</h3>
            <p>
                Darts gained popularity in the 1970s, thanks in part to the advent of televised tournaments. <br>
                The first significant televised darts competition was the News of the World Championship, which began in
                1970. <br>
                The game's exposure on TV helped it reach a broader audience and established several legendary players
                as household names. <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Professionalization</h3>
            <p>
                With increased media coverage and growing interest, the game became more professional. <br>
                The British Darts Organisation (BDO) was established in 1973 to govern and promote the sport. <br>
                However, in 1993, several top players broke away from the BDO to form the World Darts Council <br>
                (now known as the Professional Darts Corporation or PDC), which focused on more lucrative tournaments
                and higher prize money.
            </p>

            <h3>Popularity Boom</h3>
            <p>
                The 2000s saw a significant boom in darts' popularity, largely due to the PDC's efforts, <br>
                new formats, and charismatic players like Phil Taylor, Michael van Gerwen, and Gary Anderson. <br>
                The PDC's World Championship, held annually, became one of the most prestigious and highly watched
                events in the sport.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Global Reach</h3>
            <p>
                Darts is no longer limited to the United Kingdom, as it has gained a substantial global following. <br>
                Countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia have produced top-class players and host
                popular tournaments. <br>
                Today, darts continues to be a beloved sport with a dedicated fan base, regular tournaments, <br>
                and professional players competing at the highest level. It remains a staple in pubs and bars around the
                world, <br>
                providing entertainment and friendly competition for people of all ages.
