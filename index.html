                    <p>
                        The origins of darts can be traced back to medieval times in England. <br>
                        Soldiers during the Middle Ages used to throw short arrows at the bottom of a wine barrel or a
                        wooden <br>
                        target to pass the time. As the game evolved, the wooden target became a circular board, and the
                        arrows were eventually
                        replaced
                        with darts.

                        The game's popularity increased in the 19th century, particularly in the United Kingdom. <br>
                        It was played as a pub game, with various rules and regional variations. The standardization of
                        the

                        <br>
                        began in the early 20th century when the National Darts Association (NDA) was formed in Britain.

                        The NDA, established in 1924, played a significant role in standardizing the rules and
                        regulations of
                        darts. <br>
                        They introduced the numbering system we see on dartboards today, where the numbers 1 to 20 are

                        a specific pattern. The bullseye, the central circle, was also included as a high-scoring area.

                    <p>
                        Darts gained popularity in the 1970s, thanks in part to the advent of televised tournaments.
                        <br>
                        The first significant televised darts competition was the News of the World Championship, which
                        began in
                        1970. <br>
                        The game's exposure on TV helped it reach a broader audience and established several legendary
                        players
                        as household names. <br>

                        With increased media coverage and growing interest, the game became more professional. <br>
                        The British Darts Organisation (BDO) was established in 1973 to govern and promote the sport.
                        <br>
                        However, in 1993, several top players broke away from the BDO to form the World Darts Council
                        <br>
                        (now known as the Professional Darts Corporation or PDC), which focused on more lucrative
                        tournaments
                        and higher prize money.
